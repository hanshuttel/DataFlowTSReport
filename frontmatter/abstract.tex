	As ReScript introduces a strongly typed language that targets JavaScript, as an alternative to gradually typed languages, such as TypeScript.
	While ReScript is build upon OCaml, it provides its own build system and integration with JavaScript, as such not much analysis has been introduced to ReScript.
	They do provide an experimental analysis tool to analyse areas, such as dead-code and termination.
	
	As data-flow analysis have been used for decades in compiler optimization, as they provide information about the data-flow in programs.
	As many languages uses locations, the data-flow analysis must consider aliasing to ensure safety.

	In this paper, we present a type system for data-flow analysis for a subset of the ReScript language, more specific for a $\lambda$-calculus with mutability and pattern matching.
	The type system is a local analysis that collects information about what variables are used and alias information.
