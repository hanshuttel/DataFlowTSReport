	ReScript introduces a strongly typed language that targets
        JavaScript, as an alternative to gradually typed languages,
        such as TypeScript. In this paper, we present a type system
        for data-flow analysis for a subset of the ReScript language,
        more specific for a $\lambda$-calculus with mutability and
        pattern matching. The type system is a local analysis that
        collects information about what variables are used and alias
        information.
