\begin{proof}
	The proof proceeds by induction on the structure of the derivation tree for the type judgment:
	$$\Gamma,\Pi\vdash e^{p}:T$$
	In the base case, we have \runa{T-Const} and \runa{T-Var}:
	\begin{description}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/const.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/var.tex}
	\end{description}

	Next, follows the induction step:
	\begin{description}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/abs.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/app.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/let1.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/let2.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/letrec.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/case.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/ref.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/refread.tex}
		\input{sections/Proof/StrProof/refwrite.tex}
	\end{description}
\end{proof}
