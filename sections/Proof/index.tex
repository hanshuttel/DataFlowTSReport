\section{Soundness}\label{sec:Soundness}
We will now show the soundness of the type system, i.e., the type of an occurrence correspond to the dependencies and the alias information from the semantics.
To show that the type system is sound, we will first introduce the type rules for values and the relation between the semantics and the type system.
After that, we will present some properties in the semantics and type system that are used in the soundness proof.
And lastly, we will show the soundness of the type system.

\subsection{Properties}
Before we present the soundness proof, we will first present some properties about the semantics and type system.
The first property we present is for the dependency function,since the dependency function is global, and as such they can contain side effects after an evaluation.
This property states that if any new variable bindings is introduced to the dependency function, by evaluating an occurrence $e^p$, those variables are not free in $e^p$.

\begin{lemma}[History]\label{lemma:His}
	Suppose $e^p$ is an occurrence, that
	$$env\vdash\left\langle e^{p},sto,(w,\sqsubseteq_w),p'\right\rangle\rightarrow\left\langle v,sto',(w',\sqsubseteq_w'),(L,V),p''\right\rangle$$
		and $x^{p_1}\in dom(w')\backslash dom(w)$.
		Then $x\notin fv(e^{p})$
\end{lemma}
The proof for \cref{lemma:His} can be found in \cref{app:HisProof}.

%\subfile{HisProof/index.tex}

The second property is the strengthening of the type environment, which states that if there is a binding the type environment, used to type an occurrence $e^p$, and the variables is not free in $e^p$ then the binding can be removed.

\begin{lemma}[Strengthening]\label{lemma:Strength}
	If $\Gamma[x^{p'}:T'],\Pi\vdash e^{p}:T$ and $x\notin fv(e^p)$, then $\Gamma,\Pi\vdash e^{p}:T$
\end{lemma}
The proof for \cref{lemma:Strength} can be found in \cref{app:StrProof}.
%\subfile{StrProof/index.tex}

With history, \cref{lemma:His}, and strengthening, \cref{lemma:Strength}, defined we can then present the soundness theorem.
This theorem compares the semantics, for an occurrence, to a type rule that concludes this occurrence.
Since we are interested in, if the type system is a sound approximation of the semantics, we need to make sure that an evaluation of an occurrence, and the type for the occurrence agrees.
As such, we assume that the type environment and approximated order of program points are in an agreement with the binding models in the semantics, and we also assume that the environment is well-typed.

Based on these assumptions, we then need to make sure that, after an evaluation, we are still in agreement, we can type the value, and the type is in agreement with the semantics.

\begin{theorem}[Soundness of type system]
	Suppose $e^{p'}$ is an occurrence where
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $env\vdash\left\langle e^{p'},sto,(w,\sqsubseteq_w),p\right\rangle\rightarrow\left\langle v,sto',(w',\sqsubseteq_w'),(L,V),p''\right\rangle$,
		\item $\Gamma,\Pi\vdash e^{p'} : T$
		\item $\Gamma,\Pi\vdash env$
		\item $(env,sto,(w,\sqsubseteq_w))\models(\Gamma,\Pi)$
	\end{itemize}
	Then we have that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\Gamma,\Pi\vdash v:T$
		\item $(env,sto',(w',\sqsubseteq_w'))\models(\Gamma,\Pi)$
		\item $(env,(w',\sqsubseteq_w'),v,(L,V))\models(\Gamma,T)$
	\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The proof proceeds by induction on the height of the derivation tree for 
	$$env\vdash\left\langle e^{p'},sto,\psi,p\right\rangle\rightarrow\left\langle v,sto',\psi',(L,V),p''\right\rangle$$
	We will only show the proof of four rules here, for \runa{Var}, \runa{Case}, \runa{Ref}, and \runa{Ref-write}, the full proof can be found in \cref{app:SoundnessProof}.
