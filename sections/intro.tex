\section{Introduction}
Data-flow analysis is a technique of collecting information about what values various part of the program can evaluate to.
This technique is usually done by using control-flow graphs (ref), to determine the parts of a program which a set of values could propegate to.
The information gathered from the data-flow analysis is usually used by compilers for code optimization, such as live variable analysis and constant propagation analysis.

Many techniques uses data-flow equations and resolve the those equation by repeated calculations until it reaches a fix-point (Ref to Kildalls method).
While many data-flow analysis systems are path-insensitive, i.e., context insensitive, there have been developed analysis systems that are path-sensitive which can analyse alias information.
\bigskip

This paper will present a type system for data-flow and alias analysis for a functional language with mutability.
The system is a generalization of the work presented in (Insert reference to my old paper), for liveness analysis.

This paper will focus on a $\lambda$ calculus with local bindings, mutability, pattern matching, and constants.
This language is based on the ReScript language, based on OCaml for compiling to JavaScript and is part of the ML family of functional languages.
