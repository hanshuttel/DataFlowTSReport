\section{Language}\label{sec:lang}
This section will introduce a functional programming language, based on a subset of ReScript.
The language presented here is basically a $\lambda$-calculus with bindings, pattern matching and mutability.
As the purpose of the dependency analysis is to analyse each subexpression of a program and differentiate them, the language is extended to label all expressions and subexpression.
For the sake of the rest of the paper, we call the label a program point.
When labelling a syntactical element or semantical element, we call it an occurrence, such that the syntactical occurrences makes up the program, an is thus labelled expressions, while semantical occurrences are then variables and locations.

The language we present here, we assume that all local bindings, including recursive bindings, are unique.
This can also be ensured by using $\alpha$-conversion.
We also make a distinction between labelled and unlabelled expressions, such that an occurrence is a labelled expression, and unlabelled expressions are just called expressions.

In this section will first formally introduce the abstract syntax for the language, and then the semantics.
The semantics introduced here is an operational big-step semantics where we add the notion of program points and a mechanism for collecting dependencies.

\subsection{Syntax}
This section introduces the abstract syntax of the language, based on the one presented in \cite{DVNicky}.
The syntactic categories for the language is defined as:

\begin{align*}
	p\in &\;\cat{P} &-\;&\mbox{The category for program points} \\
	e\in &\;\cat{Exp} &-\;&\mbox{The category for expressions, or unlabelled occurrencens} \\
	o\in &\;\cat{Occ} &-\;&\mbox{The category for occurrences, or labelled expressions} \\
	c\in &\;\cat{Con} &-\;&\mbox{The category for constants} \\
	x,\;f\in &\;\cat{Var} &-\;&\mbox{The category for variables} \\
	\loc\in &\;\cat{Loc} &-\;&\mbox{The category for constants}
\end{align*}

We also introduce a notation for occurrences of categories where, for a category $cat$, we write $cat^\cat{P}$ to denote the pair $cat\times\cat{P}$, for expression occurrences as such:
$\cat{Exp}^\cat{P}=\cat{Exp}\times\cat{P}$.

Since the category for occurrences are labelled expressions, it can further be defined as:
$$\cat{Occ}=\cat{Exp}^\cat{P}$$

The formation rules is presented in \cref{fig:coresyntax}.

\end{figure}

Some notable constructs is further explained below.
\begin{description}
	\item[Abstractions] $\lambda\;x.o$ denotes functions with a parameter $x$ and body $o$.
		Applications uses juxtaposition, where abstractions have exactly one argument.

	\item[Constants] $c$ are either natural numbers $n$, boolean values $b$, or functional constants.
		We introduce a function $apply$, that for each functional constant $c$ returns the result of applying $c$ to its arguments.
		$$apply(PLUS,2,2)=2+2$$

	\item[Bindings] $\mbox{let} \; x \; o_1 \; o_2$ and $\mbox{let rec} \; f \; o_1 \; o_2$, also called local declarations, are immutable bindings that binds variables to values.
		We introduce two constructs for bindings which are recursive or non-recursive bindings.

	\item[Reference] $\mbox{ref\;o}$ is the construct for creating references which are handled as locations and allows for binding local declarations to them.
		We also introduces constructs for reading from a location, $!o$, and writing to a location $o_1\;:=\;o_2$.

	\item[Pattern matching] $\mbox{case} \; o_1 \; \tilde{\pi} \; \tilde{o}$, matches an occurrence with the ordered set, $\tilde{\pi}$, of patterns.
		For each pattern in $\tilde{\pi}$ there is also an occurrence in $\tilde{o}$, as such both the set of patterns and the set of occurrences must be the same size.
		We also denote the size of patterns as $|\tilde{\pi}|$ and the size of occurrences as $|\tilde{o}|$.
\end{description}

\begin{example}[]\label{ex:write}
The following occurrence:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml, mathescape=true]
(let x (ref 3$^1$)$^2$ (let y (let z (5$^3$)$^4$ (x$^5$:=z$^7$)$^8$)$^{9}$ (!x)$^{10}$)$^{11}$)$^{12}$
\end{lstlisting}
First creates a reference to the constant 3 and binds the reference to $x$ (And as such creates an alias to x).
Secondly we create a binding for $y$, where we first create a binding $z$ to the constant 5 before getting writing to the reference $x$ is bound to, to the value of $z$.
Lastly, we read the reference $x$ is bound to.
\end{example}

Later on, in (insert ref), we make use of the notion of free variables, which are defined in the usual way for $\lambda$-calculus and are as follows:
\begin{definition}[Free variables]\label{def:fv}
	The set of free variables is a function $fv:\cat{Occ}\rightarrow\Pow{\cat{Var}}$, given inductively by:
	\begin{align*}
		fv(x^p)&=\{x\}\\
		fv(c^p)&=\emptyset\\
		fv([\lambda\;y.e^{p'}]^p)&=fv(e^{p'})\backslash\{y\}\\
		fv([e_1^{p_1}\;e_2^{p_2}]^p)&=fv(e_1^{p_1})\cup fv(e_2^{p_2})\\
		fv([\mbox{let}\;y\;e_1^{p_1}\;e_2^{p_2}]^p)&=fv(e_1^{p_1})\cup fv(e_2^{p_2})\backslash\{y\}\\
		fv([\mbox{let rec}\;f\;e_1^{p_1}\;e_2^{p_2}]^p)&=fv(e_1^{p_1})\cup fv(e_2^{p_2})\backslash\{f\}\\
		fv([\mbox{case}\;e^{p'}\;(s_1,\cdots,s_n)\;(e_1^{p_1},\cdots,e_n^{p_n})]^p)&=fv(e^{p'})\cup fv(e_1^{p_1})\cup\cdots\cup fv(e_n^{p_n})\backslash(\tau(s_1)\cup\cdots\cup\tau(s_n))\\
		fv([\mbox{ref}\;e^{p'}]^p)&=fv(e^{p'})\\
		fv([!e^{p'}]^p)&=fv(e^{p'})\\
		fv([e_1^{p_1}\;:=\;e_2^{p_2}]^p)&=fv(e_1^{p_1})\cup fv(e_2^{p_2})\\
	\end{align*}
	where $\tau(s)$, for a pattern $s$, is denoted as:
	$$
	\tau(s)=
		\left\{\begin{matrix}
			\{x\} & \mbox{if}\;s=x\\ 
			\emptyset & \mbox{otherwise}
		\end{matrix}\right.
	$$
\end{definition}

\iffalse
\begin{definition}[Bound variables]\label{def:bv}
	The set of bound variables is given by:
	\begin{align*}
		bv(x^p)&=\emptyset\\
		bv(c^p)&=\emptyset\\
		bv([\lambda\;y.e_1^{p'}]^p)&=bv(e_1^{p'})\cup\{y\}\\
		bv([e_1^{p'}\;e_2^{p''}]^p)&=bv(e_1^{p'})\cup bv(e_2^{p''})\\
		bv([\mbox{let}\;y\;e_1^{p'}\;e_2^{p''}]^p)&=bv(e_1^{p'})\cup bv(e_2^{p''})\cup\{y\}\\
		bv([\mbox{let rec}\;f\;e_1^{p'}\;e_2^{p''}]^p)&=bv(e_1^{p'})\cup bv(e_2^{p''})\cup\{f\}\\
		bv([\mbox{case}\;e^{p'}\;\pi^{p''}]^p)&=bv(e_1^{p'})\cup bv(\pi)\\
		bv([(s\;e^{p'})\;\pi])&=bv(e^{p'})\cup bv(\pi)\cup\tau(s)\\
		bv([(s\;e^{p'})])&=bv(e^{p'})\cup\tau(s)\\
		bv([\mbox{ref}\;e^{p'}]^p)&=bv(e^{p'})\\
		bv([!e^{p'}]^p)&=bv(e^{p'})\\
		bv([e_1^{p'}\;:=\;e_2^{p''}]^p)&=bv(e_1^{p'})\cup bv(e_2^{p''})\\
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}
\fi

\subsection{Environments and stores}\label{sec:EnvSto}
We will now introduce the environments and stores used by the semantics, introduced in \cref{sec:sem}.
Since the language we focus on introduces mutability, through the referencing wrappers, this needs to be reflecting in our bindings model.
Here, the referencing wrappers can also be seen as how locations, or pointers, are created and handled, where we introduce stores to describe how they are bound.

Since this language is a functional language, the environment keeps the bindings we currently know, as such the environment is a function from variables to values.
The set of values, \cat{Values}, is comprised by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All constants are values.
	\item Locations are values.
	\item Closures, $\langle x,e^{p'},env\rangle$ are values.
	\item Recursive closures, $\langle x,f,e^{p''},env\rangle$, are values.
	\item Unit values, $()$, are values.
\end{itemize}

A value $v\in\cat{Values}$ is an expression given by the following formation rules:
$$v::=c\mid\loc\mid\langle x,e^{p'},env\rangle\mid\langle x,f,e^{p''},env\rangle\mid ()$$

\begin{definition}[]
	The set of all environments, \cat{Env}, is the set of partial functions from variables to values, given as:
	$$\cat{Env}=\cat{Var}\rightharpoonup\cat{Values}$$
\end{definition}
Where $env\in\cat{Env}$ denotes an arbitrary environment in \cat{Env}.

\begin{definition}[Update of environments]
	Let $env$ be an environment.
	We write $env[x\mapsto v]$ to denote the environment $env'$ where:
	\begin{align*}
		env'(y)=
		\left\{\begin{matrix}
			env(y) & \mbox{if}\;y\neq x\\\	 
			v & \mbox{if}\;y=x
		\end{matrix}\right.
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

We also introduce a function which, for a given value $v$, returns all variables that is bound to $v$.
\begin{definition}[inverse env]
	Let $v$ be a value and $env\in\cat{Env}$ be an environment, the inverse function $env^{-1}$ is then given as:
	$$env^{-1}(v)=\{x\in dom(env)\mid env(x)=v\}$$
\end{definition}

The store is a function that keeps the location bindings currently known.
We also introduce a placeholder $next$, that represents the next free location.
The store function is then given by:

\begin{definition}[]
	The set of all stores, \cat{Sto}, is the set of partial functions from locations, and the $next$ pointer, to values, given as:
	$$\cat{Sto}=\cat{Loc}\cup\{next\}\rightharpoonup\cat{Values}$$
\end{definition}
Where $sto\in\cat{Sto}$ denotes an arbitrary store in \cat{Sto}.

\begin{definition}[Update of stores]
	Let $sto$ be a store.
	We write $sto[\loc\mapsto v]$ to denote the store $sto'$ where:
	\begin{align*}
		sto'(\loc_1)=
		\left\{\begin{matrix}
			env(\loc_1) & \mbox{if}\;\loc_1\neq \loc\\\	 
			v & \mbox{if}\;\loc_1=\loc
		\end{matrix}\right.
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

We also assume the existence of a function $new:\cat{Loc}\rightarrow\cat{Loc}$, which takes a location and finds the next location.
This function is used on the location $next$ points to, to get a new free location, which is not already bound in our store.

\subsection{Dependencies}\label{sec:DepFunc}
The goal of the collection semantics is to collect the semantic dependencies as they appear in a computation. 
To this end, we use a dependency function that will tell us for each variable and location occurrence what other, previous occurrences they depend upon.

As such, the dependency function is used to model the semantic flow of dependencies in an occurrence, where we also present and ordering between those occurrences.


\begin{definition}[Dependency function]\label{def:DepFunc}
	The set of dependency functions, $\cat{W}$, is a set of partial functions from location and variable occurrences to a dependency pair, such that:
	$$\cat{W}=\cat{Loc}^P\cup\cat{Var}^P\rightharpoonup\Pow{\cat{Loc}^P}\times\Pow{\cat{Var}^P}$$
\end{definition}
A lookup in a dependency function $w$ is, for a $u^p\in\cat{Loc}^P\cup\cat{Var}^P$, such that:
$$w(u^p)=(\{\loc_1^{p_1},\cdots,\loc_n^{p_n}\},\{x_1^{p'_1},\cdots,x_m^{p'_m}\})$$
This should be read as: a lookup of an occurrence $u^p$, that is for a variable or location occurrence, returns a pair of location occurrences and a set of variable occurrences.
We also denote the pair, retrieved from the dependency function, as a dependency pair where $(L,V)$ where $L=\{\loc_1^{p_1},\cdots,\loc_n^{p_n}\}$ is the set of location occurrences and $V=\{x_1^{p'_1},\cdots,x_m^{p'_m}\}$ is the set of variable occurrences.

\begin{definition}[Update of $w$]\label{def:DepExt}
	Let $w\in\cat{W}$ be a dependency function, we write $w[u^p\mapsto(L,V)]$ to denote the dependency function $w'$ where:
	\begin{align*}
		w'(v^q)=
		\left\{\begin{matrix}
			w(v^q) & \mbox{if}\;v^q\neq u^p\\\	 
			(L,V) & \mbox{if}\;v^q=u^p
		\end{matrix}\right.
	\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Next, consider an example for the use of the dependency function $w$.

\begin{example}[]\label{ex:dep}
	Consider the example from \cref{ex:write}, we can infer the following for the dependency function:
	$$w_{ex}=[x^2\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset),z^4\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset),y^9\mapsto(\emptyset,\{x^5\}),\loc^2\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset),\loc^8\mapsto(\emptyset,\{z^7\})]$$
	Here $\loc$ denotes a location created from a reference construct.
	Here, we can see all variable bindings are distinct, while we have multiple location bindings as we first create a reference and later write to it before reading it.

	If we want to read a variable or location in $w$, we must also know for which program point, as for example, we have multiple bindings of the element $\loc$ (for program point $2$ and $8$.
	By considering \cref{ex:write}, we would like to read the information of the location $x$ is bound to, we it is easy to see that we would like to read from $\loc^8$ as the write happens later than the creation of the reference.
\end{example}

In the example above, \cref{ex:dep}, we can see that from $w$ alone it is not possible to know which occurrence to read, if we only know the value (i.e. the variable or location.
We present the notion of ordering of program points as a binary relation over program points:

\begin{definition}[]\label{def:BinRel}
	Let \cat{P} be a set of program points.
	Then $\sqsubseteq$ is a binary relation of \cat{P}, such that:
	$$\sqsubseteq\subseteq\cat{P}\times\cat{P}$$
\end{definition}

Since we are interested in the ordering of the elements in a dependency function $w$, we will define an instantiation of \cref{def:BinRel}.
Since $w$, is a function from occurrences to a pair of occurrences, we first present the function of getting the program points from a set of occurrences:

\begin{definition}[Occurring program points]\label{def:OccPP}
	Let $O$ be a set of occurrences, then $points(O)$ is given by:
	$$points(O)=\{p\in\cat{P}\mid\exists e^p\in O\}$$
\end{definition}

With \cref{def:OccPP} defined, we present the instantiation of \cref{def:BinRel} over a dependency function $w$:

\begin{definition}[]\label{def:RelPoint}
	Let $w\in\cat{W}$ be a dependency function.
	Then $\sqsubseteq_w$ is given by:
	$$\sqsubseteq_w\subseteq\{(p,p')\mid p,p'\in(points(dom(w))\cup points(ran(w)))\}$$
\end{definition}

As the dependency function is a model of which occurrences and occurrence is dependent on, and the relation on a dependency function should also model the order a value is evaluated in, we define the partial order over a dependency function.

\begin{definition}[Partial order of $w$]
	Let $w\in\cat{W}$ be a dependency function and $\sqsubseteq_w$ be a binary relation over $w$.
	We say that $w$ is partial order if $\sqsubseteq_w$ is a partial order.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[]\label{ex:depRel}
	Consider the example from \cref{ex:dep}, if we introduce a binary relation over the dependency function $w_{ex}$, such that:
	$$\sqsubseteq_{w_{ex}}=\{(2,4),(2,9),(5,9),(2,8),(7,2)\}$$
	From this ordering, it is easy to see the ordering of the elements.
	Since this ordering reflect the flow of the program in \cref{ex:write}, we know that the dependencies for the location (that x is bound to) is for the largest binding of $\loc$.
\end{example}

As presented in \cref{def:RelPoint}, the dependency function and the binary relation are used to define flow of information.
We can also see that the order defined by the binary relation $\sqsubseteq_w$, we need to lookup the greatest of $\sqsubseteq_w$.

We first present a generic function for the greatest binding of a relation $\sqsubseteq$ of program points.

\begin{definition}[Greatest binding]\label{def:GBind}
	Let $u$ be an element, either a variable or location, and $S$ be a set of occurrences, then $uf(u,S)$ is given by:
	$$uf(u,S)=\inf\{u^p\in S\mid u^q\in S.q\sqsubseteq p\}$$
\end{definition}

Based on \cref{def:GBind}, we can present an instantiation of the function for the order $\sqsubseteq_w$:

\begin{definition}[]
	Let $w$ be a dependency function, $\sqsubseteq_w$ be an order for $w$, $u$ be an element, either a variable or location, and $S$ be a set of occurrences, then $uf_{\sqsubseteq_w}$ is given by:
	$$uf_{\sqsubseteq_w}(u,w)=\inf\{u^p\in dom(w)\mid u^q\in dom(w.q\sqsubseteq_w p\}$$
\end{definition}


\begin{example}[]\label{ex:dep}
	As a continuation of \cref{ex:depRel}, we can then lookup the greatest element for an element (i.e., a variable or location).
	As we were interested in which location occurrence to lookup in $w_ex$, we can now use the function $uf_{\sqsubseteq_w}$:
	$$uf_{\sqsubseteq_{w_ex}}(\loc,w_ex)=\inf\{\loc^p\in dom(w)\mid \loc^q\in dom(w). q\sqsubseteq_{w_ex} p\}$$
	The set we get from are then as follows: $\{\loc^2,\loc^7\}$.
	From this, we find the greatest element:
	$$\loc^7=\inf\{\loc^2,\loc^7\}$$
	As we can see, from the $uf_w$ function we got $\loc^7$ which were the occurrence we wanted.
\end{example}

\subsection{Collection semantics}\label{sec:sem}
We will now introduce the big-step semantics for our language and highlight some interesting transition rules.
In the big-step semantics, the transitions are of the from:
\begin{align*}
env\vdash\left\langle e^{p'},sto,(w,\sqsubseteq_w),p\right\rangle\rightarrow\left\langle v,sto',(w,\sqsubseteq_w),(L,V),p''\right\rangle
\end{align*}
Where $env\in\cat{Env}$, $sto\in\cat{Sto}$, and $w\in\cat{W}$.
This should be read as, given the store $sto$, a dependency function $w$, A relation over $w$, and the previous program point $p$, the occurrence $e^{p'}$ evaluates to a value $v$, an updated store $sto'$, an updated dependency function $w'$, 
a updated relation over $w'$, the dependency pair $(L,V)$, and the program point $p''$ reached after evaluating $e^{p'}$, given the bindings in the environment $env$.

The transition system is given by:
$$(\cat{Occ}\cup\cat{Values})\times\cat{Store}\times(\cat{W}\times(\cat{P}\times\cat{P})\times\cat{P},\rightarrow,\cat{Values}\times\cat{Store}\times(\cat{W}\times(\cat{P}\times\cat{P}))\times\Pow{\cat{Loc}^P\times\cat{Var}^P}\times\cat{P}$$
A highlight of the rules for $\rightarrow$ can be found in \cref{fig:ColSem}, the rest can be found in \cref{App:ColSem}.

\begin{description}
	\item[\runa{Const}] rule, for the occurrence $c^{p'}$, is the simplest rule, as it has no premises and does not have any side effects.
		As constants are evaluated to the constant value, no dependencies are used, i.e., no variable or location occurrences are used to evaluate a constant.

	\item[\runa{Var}] rule, for the occurrence $x^{p'}$, uses the environment to get the value $x$ is bound to and the dependency function $w$ to get its dependencies.
		To lookup the dependencies, the function $uf_{\sqsubseteq_w}$ is used to get the greatest binding a variable is bound to, in respect to the ordering $\sqsubseteq_w$.
		Since the occurrence of $x$ is used, it is added to the set of variable occurrences we got from the lookup of $x$ dependencies.

	\item[\runa{Let}] rule, for the occurrence $[\mbox{let}\;x\;e_1^{p_1}\;e_2^{p_2}]^{p'}$, creates a local binding that can be used in $e_2^{p_2}$
		\runa{Let} evaluate $e_1^{p_1}$ to get the value $x$ will be bound to in the environment and the dependencies used to evaluate $e_1^{p_1}$ is bound in the dependency function.
		As we reach the program point $p_1$ after evaluating $e_1^{p_1}$, and it is also the program point before evaluating $e_2^{p_2}$, the binding of $x$ is $w$ is to the program points $p_1$.	

	\item[\runa{Ref}] rule, for the occurrence $[\mbox{ref} e^{p'}]^{p''}$, creates a new location and binds it, in the store $sto$, to the value evaluated from $e^{p'}$.
		The \runa{Ref} rule also binds the dependencies from evaluating the body $e^{p'}$ in the dependency function $w$ at the program point $p''$.
		As the \runa{Ref} rule only creates a location, and binds it in $sto$, the environment is not updated as there \runa{Ref} does not in itself give any alias information.
		To create an alias for a location, it should be bound to a variable using the \runa{Let} rule.

	\item[\runa{Ref-read}] rule, for the occurrence $!e^{p'}$, evaluates the body $e^{p'}$ to a value, that must be a location $\loc$, and reads the value of $\loc$ in the store.
		The \runa{Ref-read} rule also makes a lookup for the dependencies $\loc$ is bound to in the dependency function $w$, as there could be multiple bindings for $\loc$, in $w$, at different program points.
		We use the $uf_{\sqsubseteq_w}$ function to get greatest binding of $\loc$ with respect to the ordering $\sqsubseteq_w$, and we also add the location occurrence $\loc^{p'}$ to the set of locations.

	\item[\runa{Ref-write}] rule, for the occurrence $[e_1^{p_1}\;:=\;e_2^{p_2}]^{p'}$, evaluate $e_1^{p_1}$ to a location $\loc$ and $e_2^{p_2}$ to a value $v$ and binds $\loc$ in the store $sto$ to the value $v$.
		The dependency function is also extended with a new binding for $\loc$ at the program point $p'$.

\begin{example}[Data-flow for abstractions]\label{ex:DFAbs}
The following program creates a local binding to the identity function and applies it twice.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Caml, mathescape=true]
(let x ($\lambda$ y.(y$^1$))$^2$ (let z (x$^3$ 1$^4$)$^5$ (x$^6$ 2$^7$)$^{8}$)$^{9}$)$^{10}$
\end{lstlisting}
The transition tree can be found in \cref{FigEx.Abs}.
In the transition tree, we see that $\psi$ is extended a couple of times, where we will take a look at a couple of interesting extensions to $\psi$
The first time we evaluate the abstraction body, $\psi$ is on the following form:

$$\psi_2=(w_2=[x^{2}\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset), y^{4}\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset)],\sqsubseteq_w^2=\emptyset)$$
Here, the lookup of the parameter $y$ is simple, as there are only one occurrence, where we then know that $inf_{\psi_2}(y)=4$.

The second time we evaluate the body of the abstraction, $\psi$ is on the following form:

$$\psi_3=(w_3=[x^{2}\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset), y^{4}\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset), y^{7}\mapsto(\emptyset,\emptyset)],\sqsubseteq_w^2=\{4,7\})$$
Here, we now have two bindings for the parameter $y$, but since we also know that there are an ordering for the two occurrences of $y$, we then know that the program point $7$ is evaluated after $4$, as such we know that $inf_{\psi_3}(y)=7$.
